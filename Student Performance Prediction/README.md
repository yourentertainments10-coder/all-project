# Student Performance Prediction (ML Project)

This project predicts student results using a machine learning model with at least 85% accuracy. It uses classification algorithms and is optimized with Scikit-Learn. The project includes a Flask backend, HTML frontend, and a sample dataset.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Flask backend for model inference and API
- `templates/`: HTML pages for user input and result display
- `static/`: Static files (CSS, JS)
- `student_data.csv`: Sample dataset
- `model_training.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for model training
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Copilot instructions

## Getting Started
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train the model using `model_training.ipynb` or `train_model.py`
3. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`
4. Open the web interface in your browser

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
